# Etch-a-Sketch-TOP
Etch-a-Sketch like webpage that changes the color of a square when hovered over and mouse button is held down

This is my first project using javascript.  The project involves creating a grid of divs that can be 'drawn' on by holding the mouse button down and dragging across the grid.  This will cause the div to change to a random color.  There is also the ability to reset the grid, and a feature called auto-fade that makes the divs convert back to their original color after 2 seconds.
